# Lab-ECS-collisions

A small C# project showing how to create a simple collision system with [friflo ECS](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Engine.ECS).

Created the example because of a question *"How to detect collisions in an ECS"* on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nFfrhgQkb8).  
In case of questions join the Discord server.

**Goals**
- Super simple implementation using ECS queries to get the collision candidates.
- Rudimentary BBox collision logic from CoPilot. No optimizations.
- May add optimized collision detection using spatial hashing.
- Collect ideas.
